I am a forth-year Ph.D. candidate at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. Raymond Tong (AIMBE Fellow). I am also co-trained at Cavendish Laboratory for Computational Radiothreapy, the University of Cambridge, working with Prof.Rajesh Jena. I obtained my M.S. in Information and signal processing at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2019, and B.Eng in Biomedical Engineering in Beijing Institude of Techology in 2016. I'm a recipient of the CUHK Vice-Chancellor's PhD Fellowship.  
My research is centered on advancing medical image analysis through AI to foster affordable and accurate medical decision-making. Recently, I have focused on 1) unsupervised domain adaptation, 2) weakly supervised learning, 3）photoacoustic imaging and application and 4) developing clinical models for practical medical applications.
